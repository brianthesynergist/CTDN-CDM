# CTDN-Parser

This repository is set up to explore and develop efforts to generate an open source parser for inclusion and exclusion criteria on clinical trials. This repository will aim to build on the initial efforts to generate structure for the data model being developed [HERE](https://github.com/brianthesynergist/CTDN-CDM).

This effort aims to be additive and build on several existing efforts to structure clinical trial data including;

-   Efforts from Roche to [extract clinical trial data using Snorkel](https://snorkel.ai/genentech-clinical-trial-analytics-case-study/)

-   [Facebook Research Clinical Trial Parser](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Clinical-Trial-Parser)

-   Parser being developed by [Curewiki](https://curewiki.health/)
