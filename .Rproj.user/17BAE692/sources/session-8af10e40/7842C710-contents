## CTDN Common Data Model

The CTDN Common Data Model (CDM) is an open community data standard, designed to standardize the structure and content of clinical trial data, **particularly inclusion and exclusion** data to enable efficient matching of patients to clinical trials.

In addition to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we are working to include fields for additional enrichment of clinical trial records that would improve the accessibility of these trials to a diverse audience and increase their capacity to assess participation.

This site will be used to share the current status of the CTDN Common Data Model and to solicit updates and improvements to the model from the members of the [Clinical Trial Distribution](https://patientfocusedmedicine.org/trial-information-network-project/) Network's working group as well as outside contributors.

The Clinical Trial Distribution Network is managed by [PFMD](https://patientfocusedmedicine.org/). If you would like to join our group please fill out [this form](https://patientfocusedmedicine.org/trial-information-network-project/#join-now) to learn more.

If you want to suggest an update or addition to the CTDN Common Data Model please open an [issue](https://github.com/brianthesynergist/CTDN-CDM/issues). In addition, a Google Sheet of the tables below can be found at [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I8MiSuAlBokO0dPyOmZ-EJZ2CGQ1OfVCwa_WWP6OX9k/edit?usp=sharing) for either comment or further suggested edits.

The following model is being proposed for usage in the pilot version of the Clinical Trial Distribution Network. We are open to all contributions or suggested edits to this data model.

This study is designed to assess whether tumor proliferation, as measured by the natural log expression of Ki-67 staining of breast tumor cells, is reduced following approximately 2 weeks of treatment with the combination of metformin plus atorvastatin in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. |

### CTDN Parser of Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

This repository is being established and will be an effort to working in collaboration to further advance the use of ML to parse inclusion and exclusion criteria in clinical trials, building on the work originally started by Facebook and further extended by our working group partner Roche.
